# DAO Courtroom — GenLayer Mini-Game

DAO Courtroom is a multiplayer mini-game designed to showcase **GenLayer’s Intelligent Contracts** and **Optimistic Democracy consensus** through subjective decision-making.

Players participate in simulated DAO and Web3 disputes, arguing cases in natural language while GenLayer’s AI validators act as a decentralized court.

---

## Core Idea

Many real-world DAO decisions are ambiguous and cannot be resolved with deterministic rules. DAO Courtroom turns this challenge into gameplay by letting **AI consensus arbitrate disputes without a single correct answer**.

---

## Game Overview

- **Players:** 8–16 per room  
- **Duration:** 5–15 minutes  
- **Format:** Multiplayer, role-based  
- **Replayability:** Weekly with new dispute scenarios  

---

## Roles

- **Plaintiff:** Argues for a claim  
- **Defendant:** Argues against the claim  
- **Jury:** Votes on fairness  

---

## Game Flow

1. A DAO or Web3 dispute scenario is presented  
   > Example: “A contributor delivered work, but milestones were unclear. Should full payment be made?”

2. Plaintiff and Defendant submit short **natural language arguments**

3. Jury votes:
   - Plaintiff wins  
   - Defendant wins  
   - Partial outcome  

4. **AI Arbitration (GenLayer Core):**
   - Intelligent Contracts interpret arguments and context
   - Optimistic Democracy consensus among validator AIs determines the final verdict

The AI verdict may agree with or override the jury.

## XP & Leaderboard

XP is distributed subjectively:
- Advocates earn XP for clarity and persuasiveness

Weekly leaderboards encourage replayability.
